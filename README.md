# HTML-Training

Hi everyone!

This is more to keep track of the lessons and programs that I make. I will make a separate folder for all the presentable ones. 
However, I wanted to also show people that there is no quick way to learn. The progress to learning is not pretty by any means.
You have to get your hands dirty, code will look ugly, but the journey is in honing each aspect at how one person codes.

Will be updating this document as I go through the works.

Stay tuned!
